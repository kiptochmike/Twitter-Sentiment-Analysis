Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) problem where machine learning models are employed to classify text data, such as tweets, into different sentiment categories, typically positive, negative, or neutral. This process involves various techniques from classification algorithms to text mining, analysis, and visualization methods.

## Problem Statement

The task at hand involves detecting hate speech in tweets, particularly focusing on tweets with racist or sexist sentiments. The objective is to classify tweets into two categories: those containing hate speech (labeled as '1') and those that do not (labeled as '0').

In essence, given a dataset of tweets along with their corresponding labels indicating whether they contain racist/sexist sentiments or not, the goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts these labels for tweets in a test dataset.

## Success Metrics

The evaluation metric for this task is the Accuracy and F1 score.

## Objective

1) **Detect Hate Speech**: Accurately identify tweets with racist or sexist sentiments.
2) **Binary Classification**: Develop a model to categorize tweets as containing hate speech (1) or not (0).
3) **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using the F1-Score, balancing precision and recall.

## Data

The dataset contains tweets along with corresponding labels indicating whether they contain hate speech or not.
